# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to help both librarians and library members manage and track books efficiently. This system allows users to search for books, check out and return books, and allows librarians to manage the book inventory.

## Features
- **Book Search:** Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Manage Books:** Add, update, and remove books from the library inventory.
- **Borrow and Return:** Members can check out and return books using a self-service system.
- **Track Status:** View the current status of books (available, checked out, reserved, or under maintenance).

## Installation
To set up the Library Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- tkinter for the GUI
- sqlite3 for database management
